## Further Machine Learning Resources

Machine Learning community is very vibrant. Complete Machine Learning Package can get you started, but it's not enough. Fortunately, there are many faboulous learning resources, some of which are paid or freely available. Here is a list of courses that are often recommended by many people. Note that they are not listed in an order they are to be taken.

### Courses

* **Machine Learning by Coursera**: This course was taught by Andrew Ng. It is one of the most popular machine learning courses, it has been taken by over 4M of people. The course focuses more about the fundamentals of machine learning techniques and algorithms. It is free on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). 

* **Deep Learning Specialization**: Also tought by Andrew Ng., Deep Learning Specialization is also a foundations based course. It teaches a decent foundations of major deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The full course can be [audited on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), or watch freely on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0).

* **MIT Intro to Deep Learning**: This course provide the foundations of deep learning in resonably short period of time. Each lecture is one hour or less, but the materials are still the best in classs. Check the course page [here](http://introtodeeplearning.com), and lecture videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjtX1N_VT9E&list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI&index=4).

* **MIT Introduction to Data-Centric AI**: This is the first-ever course on DCAI. This class covers algorithms to find and fix common issues in ML data and to construct better datasets, concentrating on data used in supervised learning tasks like classification. All material taught in this course is highly practical, focused on impactful aspects of real-world ML applications, rather than mathematical details of how particular models work. You can take this course to learn practical techniques not covered in most ML classes, which will help mitigate the ‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù problem that plagues many real-world ML applications. Check out the course page [here](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/), lecture videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayzOzZGHZy4&list=PLnSYPjg2dHQKdig0vVbN-ZnEU0yNJ1mo5), and lab assignments [here](https://github.com/dcai-course/dcai-lab).
